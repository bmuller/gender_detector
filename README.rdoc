Gender Detector is a Ruby library that will tell you the most likely gender of a person based on first name.  It uses the underlying data from the program "gender" by Jorg Michael (described {here}[http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=22000]).

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  gem 'gender_detector'

And then execute:

  $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

  $ gem install gender_detector

== Usage

Its use is pretty straightforward:

  >> require 'gender_detector'
  >> d = GenderDetector.new
  >> d.get_gender("Bob")
  :male
  >> d.get_gender("Sally")
  :female
  >> d.get_gender("Pauley") # should be androgynous
  :andy

The result will be one of andy (androgynous), male, female, mostly_male, or mostly_female.  Any unknown names are considered andies.

I18N is supported if either UnicodeUtils or ActiveSupport are present. To get I18n support, add either one to your Gemfile:

  gem 'unicode_utils' # or gem 'activesupport'

Afterwards, gender detection will work for names with non-ASCII characters as well:

  >> d.get_gender("Álfrún")
  :female

Additionally, you can give preference to specific countries:

  >> d.get_gender("Jamie")
   => :female
  >> d.get_gender("Jamie", :great_britain)
   => :mostly_male

If you have an alterative data file, you can pass that in as an optional filename argument to the GenderDetector.  Additionally, you can create a detector that is not case sensitive (default *is* to be case sensitive):

  >> d = GenderDetector.new(:case_sensitive => false)
  >> d.get_gender "sally"
   => :female
  >> d.get_gender "Sally"
   => :female

Try to avoid creating many GenderDetectors, as each creation means reading in the data file.
